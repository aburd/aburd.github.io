      <p>Updates on sleep troubles...</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>They do continue at times, but they've gotten a whole lot better after making some changes.</p>
<h2 id="1-limit-smartphone-use">1. Limit smartphone use</h2>
<p>I did end up downloading a screentime app and it has had a big effect on me. I find myself gazing at my phone way to much, and I realize just how much time has passed since I've been spacing out on it. It's helped to live more in the moment and get more out of my days.</p>
<h2 id="2-take-care-of-things-in-a-piecemeal-manner-by-previous-worries">2. Take care of things in a piecemeal manner (by previous worries)</h2>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
<p>I've begun exercising a whole lot more. I don't yet have it down to a science, but I exercise about 3 times a week.</p>
<ul>
<li>1k running</li>
<li>Pull-ups</li>
<li>1k running</li>
<li>Chin-ups</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems to be a winning combo to generally relieving stress.</p>
<h3 id="i-have-to-move-soon">I have to move soon</h3>
<p>I've been going out to see apartments on the weekend, this activity actually spurred my girlfriend and I to talk more seriously and realistically about moving. I was somewhat frustrated that she hadn't told me earlier what she truly wanted, but she didn't actually seem to know completely until moves were actually made, and I suppose I realized I didn't either. I'm quite happy that I've started this process early.</p>
<h3 id="i-should-program-more">I should program more</h3>
<p>I've been programming a project with a friend and I've taken part as a hackthon presenter and a judge this weekend. Come to think of it, I feel like I do this stuff enough! :)</p>
<h2 id="3-appreciate-things-i-have-accomplished">3. Appreciate things I have accomplished</h2>
<p>Thinking about all the stuff I've accomplished above in 2-3 weeks, it would seem that I worry way too much.
But keeping track of all this in a blog has been helpful. I will do my best to continue this kind of practice every so now and then.</p>
<h2 id="the-rest-of-the-worries">The rest of the worries</h2>
<ul>
<li>What about all the books that I need to read that I haven't?</li>
<li>Studying computer science more seriously</li>
<li>Global warming (the weather in Japan has grown increasingly erratic, there has been record amounts of rainfallc crammed into certain months)</li>
<li>I feel like I should be more politically engaged (because, oh the world we're leaving behind)</li>
<li>I need to go to the dentist</li>
<li>I need to get my driver's license</li>
<li>I need to do my taxes</li>
</ul>
