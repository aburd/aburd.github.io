Updates on sleep troubles...
<!-- more -->
They do continue at times, but they've gotten a whole lot better after making some changes.

## 1. Limit smartphone use

I did end up downloading a screentime app and it has had a big effect on me. I find myself gazing at my phone way to much, and I realize just how much time has passed since I've been spacing out on it. It's helped to live more in the moment and get more out of my days.

## 2. Take care of things in a piecemeal manner (by previous worries)

### Exercise

I've begun exercising a whole lot more. I don't yet have it down to a science, but I exercise about 3 times a week.

- 1k running
- Pull-ups
- 1k running
- Chin-ups

It seems to be a winning combo to generally relieving stress.

### I have to move soon

I've been going out to see apartments on the weekend, this activity actually spurred my girlfriend and I to talk more seriously and realistically about moving. I was somewhat frustrated that she hadn't told me earlier what she truly wanted, but she didn't actually seem to know completely until moves were actually made, and I suppose I realized I didn't either. I'm quite happy that I've started this process early.

### I should program more

I've been programming a project with a friend and I've taken part as a hackthon presenter and a judge this weekend. Come to think of it, I feel like I do this stuff enough! :)


## 3. Appreciate things I have accomplished

Thinking about all the stuff I've accomplished above in 2-3 weeks, it would seem that I worry way too much.
But keeping track of all this in a blog has been helpful. I will do my best to continue this kind of practice every so now and then.


## The rest of the worries

- What about all the books that I need to read that I haven't?
- Studying computer science more seriously
- Global warming (the weather in Japan has grown increasingly erratic, there has been record amounts of rainfallc crammed into certain months)
- I feel like I should be more politically engaged (because, oh the world we're leaving behind)
- I need to go to the dentist
- I need to get my driver's license
- I need to do my taxes
