Ok, how about an app where you just submit images you've drawn with a stylus? The app could analyze the image for written words or other metadata and save that image along with the metadata for organization/searchability. I find blogs better than written notebooks, because I can access them from multiple platforms and it's easy to review/search for things. However, written notebooks are great because you can draw. What if you could have both?
