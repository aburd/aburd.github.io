I've been struggling to sleep lately...
<!-- more -->
I try to organize my thoughts into something cohesive, but I can't stop worrying about every little thing. I can't really seem to put my finger on it, but perhaps it's just a result of being attached to my smartphone. I constantly have this feeling like I didn't do enough with the day, but the smartphone serves as this addictive sedative. It's extremely pernicious and I can't seem to shake it.

In the background of my mind, things swirl around:

- What about all the books that I need to read that I haven't?
- Studying computer science more seriously
- How about programming a database from scratch (this one is just puzzling, why oh I why would I even want to do this)
- Global warming (the weather in Japan has grown increasingly erratic, there has been record amounts of rainfallc crammed into certain months)
- I feel like I should be more politically engaged (because, oh the world we're leaving behind)
- I have to move soon
- Is my girlfriend truly happy to be with me?
- I need to go to the dentist
- I need to get my driver's license
- I need to do my taxes
- I should program more

The smartphone seems to be this complete non-starter in all cases to meeting these worries. It's serves as a gateway to perhaps begin to start  reading about all these things, but ultimately, you get sidetracked and don't end up completing anything of substance. I really admire my girlfriend for this. There are times when she might look at her smartphone too much, but for the things she really values she seems to be able to take care of them. I, on the other hand, seem to get side-tracked by everything so easily.

## 1. Limit smartphone use

So I'll have to find some strategy to limit my smartphone use. A quick google returned back [a screentime limiting app](https://www.flipdapp.co/), but I almost fear it won't be enough. I think perhaps investing in a phone with different kind of screen may help. Ideally, something like a Hisense A5/A6 (e-ink smartphone) would be nice, but there is a lack of Google Services.  So for now, I'm going to try and install the above app and see how it goes.

## 2. Take care of things in a piecemeal manner

Also, I suppose the saying is ultimately correct, "How do you eat an elephant? One bit at a time." I'll have to take all these worries on piecemeal. I suppose some on the list won't be able to be taken care of (global warming may need a bit more time), but at least I'll be able to get some sleep.

## 3. Appreciate things I have accomplished

I think some of my worry stems from the fact that I sometimes feel like a failure, but that's entirely not the case. I've been able to bring myself to accomplish certain things, and I am on my way to accomplish some other goals. I'll have to perhaps revise some of those goals and keep track of my progress.
