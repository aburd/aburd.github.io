Recently, I've been working on two projects in addition to my job. And neither of them particularly well. Well I suppose I've been contributing to one a lot more than the other. Perhaps the payoff for that one project seems more immediate? I suppose, in a matter, is also the most "fun" project, heh. 

But all in all, all I can say is I'm absolutely floored with some people's body of work. How can people find the time to contribute so much to software? I suppose I will say that one thing I could do is use my time more wisely, but I think it's absolutely astounding that some people can have families, a job and contribute to open-source. So kudos to all you super men/women out there.

Oh yeah, and just a side note, I've been playing in gemini-space lately. I would be super cool if I could simulataneously deploy this blog onto  github and gemini-space at the same time!
