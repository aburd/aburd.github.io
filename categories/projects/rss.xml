                <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#x27;ve been working on two projects in addition to my job. And neither of them particularly well. Well I suppose I&#x27;ve been contributing to one a lot more than the other. Perhaps the payoff for that one project seems more immediate? I suppose, in a matter, is also the most &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; project, heh. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
