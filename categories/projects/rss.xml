                <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#x27;ve been working on two projects in addition to my job. And neither of them particularly well. Well I suppose I&#x27;ve been contributing to one a lot more than the other. Perhaps the payoff for that one project seems more immediate? I suppose, in a matter, is also the most &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; project, heh. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all in all, all I can say is I&#x27;m absolutely floored with some people&#x27;s body of work. How can people find the time to contribute so much to software? I suppose I will say that one thing I could do is use my time more wisely, but I think it&#x27;s absolutely astounding that some people can have families, a job and contribute to open-source. So kudos to all you super men&#x2F;women out there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and just a side note, I&#x27;ve been playing in gemini-space lately. I would be super cool if I could simulataneously deploy this blog onto  github and gemini-space at the same time!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
